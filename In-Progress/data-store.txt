set-business-hours has gone the way of add/edit users !

the updated list (looking pretty sparse nowadays):
-login
-logout
-displaySchedule
-generateSchedule
-alterAvailability
-selectEmployee


data store for CDJ Scheduler:

[hard-coded (not part of the normal functionality)]
-business hours (days of the week, start/stop times, number of employees)
-users (username, password, full name, is Schedule Manager)

[standard]
-employee availability (days of the week, start/stop times)
-a schedule (days of the week, which employees are working each day)
